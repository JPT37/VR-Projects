# VR-Projects
One simple and one more complex VR Project. Very rudementary.
Hello, this is the combination of my simple vr project and the final vr project. The simple one is the first scene named fun area, where you can bowl and teleport around.
There is a menu that states the controls and has buttons for the menu, one to load the shooting gallery and play in that area.

The controls differ slighty in the shooting gallery area, where the touchpad is teleport.
There are some collisions issues in the shooting gallery area that I could not solve, though usually waiting a bit will result in the targets working correctly. There is also supposed to be a timer, but for some reason the timer would not start counting down no matter what I did.

The references for the project will be included in the paper.
